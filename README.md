# GTM Server-Side Debugging Tag  

## 🚀 Overview  

This tag is designed to simplify your debugging process by leveraging the power of **Google Tag Manager Server-Side**.

## 🛠️ How It Works  

1. **Intercept Messages:**  
   The tag listens for specific events and captures messages sent during execution.  

2. **Aggregate Data:**  
   The captured data is organized and stored, ready for analysis or further processing.  

3. **Set Response Body:**  
   The aggregated data is injected into the response body, simplifying data validation and debugging.

## 🔍 Use Case Example  

Imagine debugging an event flow where data is sent to multiple endpoints. 
Instead of manually checking logs or switching tabs, this tag aggregates everything in one place and includes it in the response body, providing a holistic view of the event flow.
